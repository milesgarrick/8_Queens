# 8_Queens

This repo holds a genetic algorithm implementation that solves the 8 Queens problem.

## Build Instructions

Make sure the random and math libraries are installed.  Run with the command `python3 main.py`.

## Testing

Change the value of `init_pop` at line 105 in main.py to test different population sizes.

The program outputs the average population fitness as single values to data.txt in the working directory.
